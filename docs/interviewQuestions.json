I’m your Personalized AI that understands YOU from day one, with you always in control.\n\nBefore we start working together, I’d love to learn a bit more about: \n - how you study \n - what motivates you \n - what kind of explanations feel natural to you.\n\nThis short-written questionnaire helps me understand your style so I can adapt to you — and only you.\n\n🤝 The goal is simple: we are a team. I’ll bring structure, clarity, and personalized explanations, and you bring your goals, your curiosity, and your feedback.\n\nThere are no right or wrong answers. Just choose what feels honest, comfortable, and true to you.\n\nYour responses guide how I support you, but you always have the final say.\n\n⏱ The questionnaire takes about 15 minutes.\n\n✨ Begin whenever you're ready — let’s build your personalized learning experience together."
